# Merge-Crafting-Prototype

This is a little prototype I created to test out an idea I had for a simple crafting mechanic where players can pick up two items and merge them together to create new items or upgrade existing items.

It plays a bit like a puzzle game, where you need to try out different item combinations to achieve specific objectives.
